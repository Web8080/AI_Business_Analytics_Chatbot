## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Avoid:** "Tell me about sales"
✅ **Better:** "What is the total sales revenue this month?"

### 2. Ask One Thing at a Time

❌ **Avoid:** "What are the top products and what's the revenue and which customers bought the most?"
✅ **Better:** 
- First: "What are the top products?"
- Then: "What is the total revenue?"
- Then: "Which customers bought the most?"

### 3. Use Clear Language

❌ **Avoid:** "Show me the thingies that sold good"
✅ **Better:** "Show me the best-selling products"

### 4. Reference Your Data Columns

If your CSV has columns like "product_name", "revenue", "quantity":
- ✅ "What is the total revenue?"
- ✅ "Show me products by quantity sold"
- ✅ "What product has the highest revenue?"

### 5. Start Broad, Then Narrow Down

1. Start: "Show me a summary"
2. Then: "What are the top products?"
3. Then: "Tell me more about the #1 product"

### 6. Use the Quick Actions

When you're not sure what to ask, click the Quick Action buttons to get started!
