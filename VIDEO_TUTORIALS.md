"- Excel: File > Save As > CSV
- Google Sheets: File > Download > CSV
- Database tools: Usually an Export function
- Point of Sale systems: Check your export options"

**[FILE SIZE - 0:50-1:10]**

"You can upload files up to 200MB. For reference:

- Medium dataset: 10-50MB
- Large dataset: 50-200MB

Most business data is well under this limit."

**[COMMON ISSUES - 2:00-2:40]**

"What if something goes wrong?"

**[SHOW: Error scenarios]**

"If you see 'File format not supported':
- Make sure it's a .csv file
- Not .xlsx or .xls - export to CSV first

If you see 'File too large':
- Your file is over 200MB
- Filter your data or split into smaller files

If upload hangs:
- Check your internet connection
- Try a smaller file first
- Refresh the page and try again"

**[BEST PRACTICES - 2:40-3:00]**

"Pro tips:
1. Use clear column headers
2. One record per row
3. Remove formulas before exporting
4. Check for special characters
