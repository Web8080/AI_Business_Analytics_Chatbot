- Custom domain support (Pro plan)

### App Settings

In Streamlit Cloud dashboard → Settings:

**General:**
- App name
- Repository and branch
- Main file path

**Secrets:**
- Environment variables
- API keys
- Configuration values

**Resources:**
- Auto-sleep settings (free tier sleeps after inactivity)

---

## 📊 Monitoring Your App

### View Logs

1. Go to your app in Streamlit Cloud
2. Click **"Manage app"**
3. View real-time logs

### Check Status

Dashboard shows:
- Build status
- App status (running/stopped/error)
- Last deployment time
- Resource usage

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue:** Requirements installation fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check `requirements_streamlit.txt` syntax
2. Verify package versions are compatible
3. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

**Common fix:**
```bash
# If a package fails, try removing version constraint
# Before: pandas>=2.1.0
# After: pandas
```

### App Won't Start

**Issue:** App shows error on launch

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs for error messages
2. Verify `dashboard_openai.py` is at repository root
3. Test locally first: `streamlit run dashboard_openai.py`

### Slow Performance

**Issue:** App is slow to respond

**Solutions:**
1. Free tier has limited resources
2. Large file uploads take longer
3. Consider Streamlit Cloud Pro for better performance
4. Optimize code for cloud (caching, etc.)

### App Sleeps

**Issue:** App goes to sleep after inactivity (free tier)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Free tier apps sleep after 7 days of inactivity
- Wake up automatically when accessed
- First load after sleep takes ~30 seconds

**Solutions:**
- Upgrade to Streamlit Cloud Pro (no sleep)
- Or accept the cold start delay

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

✅ **DO:**
- Use Streamlit Secrets for API keys
- Store sensitive data in secrets
- Use environment variables

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit API keys to GitHub
- Hardcode passwords
- Expose sensitive data in logs

### Data Privacy

**How it works:**
- User uploads stay in memory
- Data is NOT stored on disk
- Data is cleared when session ends
- Each user has isolated session

**In Fallback Mode:**
- 100% local processing (in user's browser session)
- No external API calls
- Complete privacy

**In OpenAI Mode:**
- Only question + data context sent to OpenAI
- OpenAI API doesn't train on your data
- Data encrypted in transit
