## Quick Test Script

```python
# Test the chatbot with these questions in sequence:
questions = [
    "What is the total revenue?",
    "Show me the top 5 products",
    "Which region has the highest sales?",
    "What are the trends?",
    "Can you forecast next month's sales?"

## Troubleshooting

**Chatbot not responding?**
- Check if file is uploaded
- Verify column names in your CSV
- Try simpler questions first

**Model accuracy showing N/A?**
- Run `python demo_run.py` first to generate results
- Check if results/*.json files exist

**Upload failing?**
- Check file size (should be < 50MB)
- Verify it's a valid CSV file
- Check for encoding issues
