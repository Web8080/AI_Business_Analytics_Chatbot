## ⚡ Performance Note

### Slow Startup After Upload?

**This is NORMAL on Streamlit Cloud free tier!** Here's why:

#### What's Happening:
1. **File uploads** - Processed immediately ✅
2. **Agent initialization** - Takes 5-10 seconds first time
3. **Loading 100K+ patterns** - Happens in background
4. **Tab navigation** - Manual click needed

#### Why It's Slow:
- **Free tier** has limited resources (1GB RAM)
- **Cold start** - First load after upload takes time
- **Python 3.13** - Newer, slightly slower initialization
- **100,000+ patterns** - Rich intent matching database loading

#### This is EXPECTED and NORMAL for free hosting! ✅

## 💡 How to Use After Upload

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Upload CSV** in sidebar → Wait for "✅ Loaded" message
2. **Click "🤖 AI Chatbot" tab** at the top
3. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for chat interface to appear (first time)
4. **Start asking questions!**

### After First Load:
- **Subsequent questions are FAST** (~0.5-1 second)
- **Agent is cached** - No reload needed
- **Charts generate quickly**

### Measured Times:
- **File upload:** < 2 seconds ✅
